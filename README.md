# MyRepo
Assignment1r
For this Assignment, I first created MyRepo and published it. I created a "TestBranch" branch and opened this using Pycharm. In Pycharm, I created a new file to type the questions and answers into. When I finished, I committed this file to TestBranch in Pycharm. I then went to github.com and created a pull request of this branch to the master. I then merged the pull request from TestBranch when it was confirmed there were no errors.
